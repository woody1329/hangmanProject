# hangmanProject
Hangman folder contains the hangman game and the file of words. The words are 
somewhat obscure and the default settings make for quite a hard game, so give
it a try and you will be addicted in no time.
The XUnitTestProject1 contains some xunit tests that were used to drive the initial 
development ala TDD, but are less relevant as I've polished parts of the game.
